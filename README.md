#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering refers to the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems. Furthermore, simply put, it involves the designing, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Software engineering is an indispensable aspect of the technology industry as it enables the creation of applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. development of programming languages
2. the rise of agile methodologies
3. establishment of software engineering as a discipline.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements -gathering and documenting user needs
2. design - creating high-value and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
3. implementation - writing code and building the software according to design specifications
4. testing - conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
5. deployment - releasing the software to the end users
6. maintenance - providing ongoing support updates and enhancements to the software after deployment 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall is a linear, sequential project management approach where each phase must be completed before moving to the next. It's often likened to a waterfall, where progress
flows steadily downwards whereas Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to project management, emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction.
SCENARIOS
1. Waterfall - Building a bridge. The engineering plans must be finalized before construction begins, and there's little room for changes once construction is underway.
2. Agile - Developing a mobile app. Market trends and user feedback can change rapidly, requiring frequent adjustments to the app's features. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software developer -responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
2. Quality Assurance - ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans .
3. Project Manager - oversees the planning ,execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development. Give examples of each.
Importance of IDEs 
1. Increased productivity: IDEs offer features like code completion, syntax highlighting, and refactoring, which significantly boost developer efficiency.
2. Improved code quality: Built-in code analysis tools help identify potential errors and inconsistencies early in the development process.
3. Enhanced debugging: Debuggers integrated into IDEs facilitate effective troubleshooting.   
4. Simplified project management: IDEs often include project management tools to organize code and resources.   
5. Cross-platform development: Many IDEs support multiple programming languages and platforms.
Examples of IDE include Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, PyCharm, and Xcode.

Importance of VCS 
1. Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same codebase simultaneously without conflicts.
2. Backup and recovery: VCS creates regular backups of the code, preventing data loss.   
3. Experimentation: Developers can try different approaches without fear of losing the original code.
4. Code review: VCS facilitates code review and quality assurance.   
5. Tracking changes: The history of code changes is maintained, making it easier to identify the source of issues.
Examples of VCS are Git, Subversion (SVN) and Mercurial   



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
challenges -changing requirements,tight delays, and technical debt
Strategies to overcome them include -effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
  - Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
  - System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
  - Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Importance of Quality Control: Quality control measures such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 Prompt engineering tells a robot exactly what information one needs and how they wants it presented. This is important in interacting with AI models because it ensures accurate feedback.

Tell me about climate change.
This prompt is vague because it doesn't specify what information is desired. It leaves too much room for interpretation and could result in a very broad, general response.

Improved Prompt:
Analyze the impact of rising sea levels on coastal cities in Southeast Asia due to climate change.
This prompt is clear, specific, and concise. It specifies a particular aspect of climate change (rising sea levels), a specific geographic region (Southeast Asia), and a particular type of impact (on coastal cities.
